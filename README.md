# About-Me
My name is Brian. I am a tech enthusiast and an avid gamer.

I am currently a first year student at Singapore Institute of Technology, taking a [Bachelor of Science with Honours in Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/applied-artificial-intelligence)

I am a graduate of Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Information Technology, with experience in a variety of programming languages, computer systems and network. I am always curious about computers/tech, discovered my passion for Artificial Intelligence during my Machine Learning elective module hence, I decided to furhter my education in SIT with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

 In my free time, I research upcoming tech, such as new releases of central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs), and technologies like NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) and AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) that enhance performance of existing systems. I find such technologies fascinating because they use complex algorithms and machine learning to unlock more performance from current hardware.

 I enjoy a hands-on approach to computer systems. I have been assembling my own computers since 2016, periodically upgrading them part by part. I have also performed maintenance and repairs on multiple laptops, including swapping out old hard drives for solid-state drives, adding additional RAM for smoother multitasking, and even replacing worn-out batteries. Once, I improved my laptop's unsatisfactory wireless speed by replacing the Wi-Fi card with a faster one.

My experience with both software and hardware, through education, and hobby, has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the integration between software and hardware in computer systems.
