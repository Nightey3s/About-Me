# About-Me
My name is Brian. I am a tech enthusiast and an avid gamer.

I am currently a first year student at Singapore Institute of Technology, taking a [Bachelor of Science with Honours in Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/undergraduate-programmes/applied-artificial-intelligence)

I am a graduate of Singapore Polytechnic's Diploma in Information Technology, with experience in a variety of programming languages, computer systems and network. I am always curious about computers/tech, discovered my passion for Artificial Intelligence during my Machine Learning elective module hence, I decided to furhter my education in SIT with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

During my free time, I like to research upcoming tech, such as new releases of Central/Graphic Processing Units, and technologies that enhances performance of existing systems such as NVIDIA's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR). I find such technology to be facinating as it allows us to gain more performance out of the current hardware by using complex algorithms/machine learning.

I enjoy a hands-on approach with computer systems, and have been assembling my own computers since 2016, periodically upgrading my computer part by part. I have also performed "operations" on multiple laptops, such as swapping out the old hard drive for a blazing fast solid state drive, or adding additional Random Access Memory (RAM) to allow for smoother multi-tasking operations, even replacing the old, worn out battries for new ones. Once, I found the wireless speed of my laptop to be unsatisfactory, and I fixed it by changing out the wifi card for a faster one.

My experience with both software and hardware, through education, and hobby, has allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the integration between software and hardware in computer systems.
